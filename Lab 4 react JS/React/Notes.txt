React Router
	Routing is a process in which a user is directed to different pages based on their action or request
	ReactJS Router is mainly used for developing Single Page Web Applications.
	React Router is used to define multiple routes in the application.
	When a user types a specific URL into the browser, and if this URL path matches any 'route' inside the router file, the user will be redirected to that particular route.

React contains three different packages for routing. These are:
	react-router: It provides the core routing components and functions for the React Router applications.
	react-router-native: It is used for mobile applications.
	react-router-dom: It is used for web applications design.
	
	npm install react-router-dom --save
